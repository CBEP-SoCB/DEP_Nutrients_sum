## Delete Bad Temperature Data
We note a series of low temperature data.  These appear to be problematic. There
is a collection of temperature values below 1 C in spring and summer months, 
which is unlikely. We delete those questionable temperature values. 

```{r}
sonde_data <- sonde_data %>%
  mutate(temp = if_else(temp < 5,
                 NA_real_, temp))
```

# Summary of Metadata
## QA/QC Samples
We conducted no analysis of QA/QC samples, and simply deleted then from the data
to avoid confusion.

## Censoring Flags
While preparing our working data, we separated raw observations from text
annotations, including data quality flags.  In the sonde-related data, we only
had to contend with (1) left censoring of turbidity data , and (2) data quality 
flags on all chlorophyll data.

Since all sonde-related chlorophyll data was flagged as of questionable 
accuracy (with "J" flags), it does us no good to track that information during 
further analysis.  We retain all data, but recognize that it's accuracy is 
suspect, especially in comparison to laboratory results. We believe the 
"J" flags reflect the fact that these are "raw" estimates of chlorophyll based
only on observed florescence, never recalibrated based on laboratory samples.

We also had a few "U<"  flags in the Turbidity data.  We separated out a 
`TRUE` / `FALSE` flag to indicated censored values, with the name 
'turbidity_cens`.

## Units
Our derived data files lack any indication of units.  Units were documented
in the source Excel files.  We summarize relevant information here.

# Review of Sonde Data
## Scatterplot Matrix (Pairs Plot)
```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7 }
tmp <- sonde_data %>%
  select(depth:turbidity)
ggpairs(log(tmp), progress = FALSE)
```

Many of the low turbidity values are at NTU = 0.001, but they are not flagged as 
censored observations.  We suspect but can not document that these are minimum
possible values on the sensor, and thus may be functionally censored values.

We see expected general correlations, somewhat blunted by complexity of sampling
histories, with multiple sites and dates.

## Sites by Depths (Useless?) 
```{r}
tmp <- sonde_data %>%
  mutate(dpth_clss = if_else(depth < 2, round(depth, 1), round(depth,0)))
xtabs(~ dpth_clss + site, data = tmp)
rm(tmp)
```

Most sonde data appears to be downcast data, with data collected at (or
near) specific depths.  It looks like there has been inconsistency of handling 
shallow water samples.  Some sites shallow samples may have been used to 
estimate K~d~.

## How often was each site sampled?
We make an assumption here that sampling on one day is all related.

```{r}
tmp <- sonde_data %>%
  group_by(site, sample_date) %>%
  summarize(was_sampled = sum(! is.na(depth)) > 1,
            .groups = 'drop')
xt <- xtabs(~ sample_date + site, data = tmp)
tot <- colSums(xt)
tot
names(tot[tot > 20])
rm(tmp, xt)
```

We see clearly that certain sites had sonde data collected much more frequently.
Most of those are FOCB "profile" Sites, so it is likely there is some data 
overlap with the FOCB downcast data.

We can emphasize data from selected sites, which may clarify what is going on.
WeE chose first to process data from sites with at least 29 sampling dates.
lets look at site "FR09"

```{r}
sonde_data %>%
  filter(site == 'FR09', year == 2018) %>%
ggplot(aes(sample_date, depth, color = do, size = temp)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_gradient2(midpoint = 9, 
                         low = scales::muted("yellow", l = 90),
                         mid = scales::muted("lightgreen", l = 50),
                         high = scales::muted("lightblue", l = 20, c = 100)) +
   scale_y_reverse()
```

```{r}
sonde_data %>%
  filter(site == 'FR09', year == 2018) %>%
ggplot(aes(sample_date, depth, color = temp, size = do)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_colour_gradient2(midpoint = 15, 
                         high = scales::muted("red"), 
                         low = scales::muted("blue")) +
   scale_y_reverse()
```

To create a more typical depth-time plot we need to create data with equally 
spaced (interpolated) values. That is beyond our current scope.
