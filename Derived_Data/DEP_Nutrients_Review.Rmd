# Introduction
This R Notebook focuses on continued review of contents of the DEP nutrient 
data.  We focus here on data on concentration of nitrogen species, and examine 
the spatial and temporal distribution of data.

# Summary of Metadata
## QA/QC Samples
We conducted no analysis of QA/QC samples, and simply deleted then from the data
to avoid confusion.

## Data Quality Flags and Censoring Flags
While preparing our working data, we separated raw observations from text
annotations, including data quality flags.  

We had "J", 'J*", "B" and "JB" flags to contend with.  While the metadata we
received from DEP did not include definitions of all flags, these are
conventionally used to indicate that values are to be treated as "estimated
values" because of uncertain precision, especially for values between instrument
detection and contracted detection or quantitation limits.   Where data quality
flags existed after deleting the QA/QC samples, we collapsed them down to a
`TRUE` / `FALSE` flag indicating whether samples were flagged or not. These 
flags follow a consistent naming convention, with the variable name followed by
an underscore and "flag".

We also had a few "U",  "U<" and ">" flags.  These represent censored values,
either right censored ( ">") for Secchi depth, or left censored for other 
parameters.  Again, we separated out a `TRUE` / `FALSE` flag to indicated 
censored values.  These flags also follow a consistent naming convention, with 
the variable name followed by an underscore and "cens".

## Units
Our derived data sources lack clear indication of units, which were documented
in the source Excel files.  We summarize relevant information here.

Variable Name |  Meaning                 | Units                 |  
--------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|  
site_name     | DEP "Site ID"            |                       |  
site          | DEP "Sample Point ID" without depth designation |    |  
depth_designation | DEP depth designation from "Sample Point ID" | |
sample_date   | Date of sample collection    | yyyy-mm-dd format     |

phaeo     | Phaeophytin                   | UG/L                 |
nox_n     | Nitrate + Nitrite As N        | MG/L                 |

## Cross Occurrances of Data
We are interested in figuring out what data occurs with other data.  A giant
`xtab()` is possible, but unwieldy for more than three variables.

We instead reducing all VARIABLES to the value 1 if data exists, and zero
otherwise.  We then look at correlations between data categories.

```{r}
tmp <- dep_data %>%
  select(chl:tss) %>%
  select_if(is.numeric) %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ as.numeric( ! is.na(.x))))
round(cor(tmp, use = 'pairwise'),2)
```

# Depth Distribution of Samples
```{r}
ggplot(dep_data, aes(depth)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```
So we still need to worry about depths. 

```{r}
tmp <- dep_data %>%
  mutate(dclass = cut(depth,c(0,1,2, 5, 20)))
         
 xtabs(~ dclass + depth_designation, data = tmp, addNA = TRUE)
```

So overall, it looks like the depth designations are *almost* consistent.
There are nine samples that lack a depth designation that were collected 
at depth.  These are likely to be bottom samples, as all have depth reported as 
over 10 meters.  We treat them as such here, and give them the depth designation 
of "bot" (lowercase) so we remember that the designation has been added, and 
was not part of the original data.

```{r}
dep_data %>%
  filter(depth > 5, is.na(depth_designation))
```

```{r}
dep_data <- dep_data %>%
  mutate(depth_designation = if_else(depth > 5 & is.na(depth_designation),
                                     'bot', depth_designation))

tmp <- dep_data %>%
  mutate(dclass = cut(depth,c(0,1,2, 5, 20)))
xtabs(~ dclass + depth_designation, data = tmp, addNA = TRUE)
```

There are VERY few samples collected at maximum chlorophyll, so these
data are not be of much use.

# Surface Data Only
## Nutrients
```{r}
surface_data <- dep_data %>%
  filter(depth_designation == 'SUR' | is.na(depth_designation))
```


There are a few sky-high NH4 values.  Let see where they occurred.

```{r}
surface_data %>%
  filter(nh4_n > 2.5)
```

All have identical values of NH$  = 4, and all are flagged as being outside of 
normal hold times, and all had flags indicating they are censored as "<4" these
are probably best handled as missing data, so we delete the nh4-n data.

We have a few more NH4 values at `nh4_n == 0.4`, which are 
clearly also oddballs.

```{r}
surface_data %>%
  filter(nh4_n < 2.5, nh4_n > 0.3)
```

Again, all have identical values of 0.4, all are flagged as censored, and 
all are flagged as being outside of hold times.

### Correct Misleading NH4 values
```{r}
surface_data <- surface_data %>%
  mutate(nh4_n = if_else(nh4_n > 0.3, NA_real_, nh4_n))
```

### Nitrogen
#### Pairs Plot
```{r}
tmp <- surface_data %>%
  select(site, sample_date, nox_n:tp_flag) %>%
  select(where(is.numeric))

ggpairs(tmp, progress = FALSE)

```

```{r}
ggpairs(log(tmp), progress = FALSE)
```

None of those correlations are especially high. The highest are
for tn and nox_n, and op and tp. Neither is surprising.

Note discrete nature of low values for nox_n and nh4_n.  those should mostly be
censored observations, but we can't be sure here.

#### DIN and Organic N
We can calculate DIN as the sum of ammonium and nitrate, and organic N as the 
difference between DIN and TN.

```{r}
surface_data <- surface_data %>%
  mutate(din = nh4_n + nox_n,
         din_cens = nh4_n_cens | nox_n_cens,
         din_flag = nh4_n_flag | nox_n_flag,
         on       = tn - din,
         on_flag  = din_flag | tn_flag,
         on_cens_r  = din_flag)    #since this is calculated by difference

```

##### Ternary Diagrams
```{r calc_proportions}
proportion_data <- surface_data %>%
  select(site:hour, nox_n:tn_flag, din:on_cens_r) %>%
  relocate(nh4_n, on, tn, .after = nox_n)%>%
  mutate(across(nox_n:on, ~ .x/tn)) %>%
  
  relocate(nh4_n_flag, on_flag, tn_flag, .after = nox_n_flag) %>%
  relocate(nh4_n_cens, on_cens_r, .after = nox_n_cens) %>%
  
  select(site, sample_date, year, nox_n:on_flag, ) %>%
  filter(! is.na(nox_n), ! is.na(nh4_n), ! is.na(on))
```

###### Draft Plots
We borrowed function to simply add alpha values to color palettes from here:
[Description](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2014/03/colorramppalettealpha-and-addalpha-helper-functions-for-adding-transparency-to-colors-in-r/)
[GitHub](https://github.com/mylesmharrison/colorRampPaletteAlpha/blob/master/colorRampPaletteAlpha.R)

```{r transparency_fxn}
addalpha <- function(colors, alpha=1.0) {
  r <- col2rgb(colors, alpha=T)
  # Apply alpha
  r[4,] <- alpha*255
  r <- r/255.0
  return(rgb(r[1,], r[2,], r[3,], r[4,]))
}
```

###### Colored by Censored Data
```{r ternary_data_quality, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
pal = addalpha(cbep_colors(), 0.5)

TernaryPlot(alab = 'Nitrate', blab = 'Ammonium', clab = 'Organic',
            grid.lines = 5, grid.minor.lines = 0)
TernaryPoints(proportion_data[4:6], pch = 16, 
              col = pal[as.numeric(proportion_data$on_flag) + 1])

legend('topleft', ncol = 1,
        cex = .75,
        legend = c('Data OK', 'Data Flag'),
        box.lty = 0,
        pch = 20,
        col = cbep_colors())
```

###### Colored by Censored Data
```{r ternary_censoring, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
pal = addalpha(cbep_colors(), 0.5)

TernaryPlot(alab = 'Nitrate', blab = 'Ammonium', clab = 'Organic',
            grid.lines = 5, grid.minor.lines = 0)
TernaryPoints(proportion_data[4:6], pch = 16, 
              col = pal[as.numeric(proportion_data$on_cens_r) + 1])

legend('topleft', ncol = 1,
       cex = .75,
        legend = c('Uncensored', 'Censored'),
        box.lty = 0,
        pch = 20,
        col = cbep_colors()[1:2])
```

Note the one point that falls outside of is basically a site where TN is very 
close to DIN, so there was a slight negative estimate of ON.  It's from TB01
from 07/21/2016. Other "low" ON sites are not related in any obvious way.

###### Produce PDF
We have slightly more control of size when we specify the graphics 
device, as we can specify fonts and base font size.

```{r ternary_pdf, fig.width = 3.5, fig.height = 3.5}
cairo_pdf('ternary.pdf', width = 3.5, height = 5,
          family = 'Montserrat', pointsize = 8)

TernaryPlot(alab = 'Nitrate', blab = 'Ammonium', clab = 'Organic',
            grid.lines = 5, grid.minor.lines = 0)
TernaryPoints(proportion_data[4:6], pch = 16, 
              col = pal[as.numeric(proportion_data$on_flag) + 1])

legend('topleft', ncol = 1,
       cex = .75,
        legend = c('Data OK', 'Data Flag'),
        box.lty = 0,
        pch = 20,
        col = cbep_colors())
dev.off()
```

##### Histograms / Distributions
Data is distributed fairly close to log-normal, although it is slightly
heavy tailed and more skewed.

```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(surface_data, aes(tn)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = site)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.35, col = 'grey35') +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 0.6, col = 'grey35')
```

So, in these data, the difference between eelgrass-oriented standards at about
0.35 mg/l versus dissolved oxygen standards at about 0.6 mg/l is huge.

### Phosphorus
```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(surface_data, aes(tp)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = site, color = tp_cens)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c('black', 'yellow')) + 
  scale_x_log10()
```

So very little of the data is censored.

## N to P ratios
```{r}
surface_data <- surface_data %>%
  mutate(n_to_p = tn/tp)
```

```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(surface_data, aes(n_to_p)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = site)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 15, col = 'grey35')
```

Generally, our N:P ratios are well below 15, suggesting continued N limitation.
Is that worth reporting on?  There may be N:P ratio variation between sites.

## Chlorophyll and Phaeophytin
This data does not include all chlorophyll data, because of ambiguities of 
labeling in the source data.See "DEP_Nutrients_Preparation.Rmd" for details.

```{r}
tmp <- surface_data %>%
  select(site, sample_date, chl, phaeo)
```

```{r}
tmp %>%
  select(chl, phaeo) %>%
  mutate(chl_to_p = chl / phaeo) %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), log)) %>%
  ggpairs(progress = FALSE)
```

We see a lot of samples with phaeophytin well above chlorophyll levels.
that is not impossible, but noteworthy.  It's worth looking at the scatter plot
with a 1:1 reference line and with data wit hdata quality flags marked

```{r}
tmp <- surface_data %>%
  select(site, sample_date,
         chl, phaeo,
         chl_flag, phaeo_flag, 
         chl_cens, phaeo_cens)

ggplot(tmp, aes(chl, phaeo)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = chl_flag | phaeo_flag), alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0) +
  scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10() +
  coord_equal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = cbep_colors(), name = 'Data Quality Flag') +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12)
```

## Chlorophyll and Nutrients
```{r}
tmp <- surface_data %>%
  select(site, sample_date, chl, phaeo, op_p, tp, tn, din, on, tss)
```

```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
tmp %>%
  select(-site, -sample_date
         ) %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), log)) %>%
  ggpairs(progress = FALSE)
```

Interestingly, The strongest correlation between chlorophyll and nutrients is with 
TP, not TN.   Phaeophytin is correlated with Total N and organic N as well.
Total suspended solids is  correlated with most metrics, suggesting it is 
functioning here a surrogate for plankton abundance, which will be 
correlated with everything.
