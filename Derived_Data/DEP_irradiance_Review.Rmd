# Introduction
In this notebook, we review  Maine DEP irradiance data and calculate light
attenuation coefficients (k values.)  We export a data set consisting of K
estimates, sample sizes, and estimated standard errors of those estimates.

# Review of theory
Light attenuation is often measured as 
$$
I_d = I_0 e^{-kz}
$$
Where $z$ is depth.

$$
\frac{I_d}{I_0} = e^{-kz}
$$


$$
log(\frac{I_d}{I_0}) = -kz
$$

Note that this produces a value of k at each depth. If we assume this theory is
accurate and light attenuation is vertically uniform, we can average across 
depths to improve accuracy. 

$$ k = \frac{1}{-z} \times log(\frac{I_d}{I_0}) $$

Where we recast values as percentages of surface light, we can estimate k~d as

$$ k \approx - \frac{log(I_d)}{z}$$

We want to recast that as a linear regression problem.

Y = mx + b

log(Id) = -kz

So, K can be estimated as the negative of linear coefficient of depth in a 
linear model.

# Summary of Metadata
## QA/QC Samples
We conducted no analysis of QA/QC samples, and simply deleted them from the data
to avoid confusion.

## Censoring Flags
While preparing our working data, we separated raw observations from text
annotations, including data quality flags.  In the sonde-related data, we only
had to contend with (1) left censoring of turbidity data, and (2) data quality 
flags on all chlorophyll data.

Since all sonde-related chlorophyll data was flagged as of questionable 
accuracy (with "J" flags), it does us no good to track that information during 
further analysis.  We retain all data, but recognize that it's accuracy is 
suspect, especially in comparison to laboratory results.

We also had a few "U<"  flags in the Turbidity data.  We separated out a 
`TRUE` / `FALSE` flag to indicated censored values, with the name 
'turbidity_cens`.

## Units
Our derived data files lack any indication of units.  Units were documented
in the source Excel files.  We summarize relevant information here.

Variable Name |  Meaning                 | Units                 |  
--------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|  
site_name     | DEP "Site ID"            |                       |  
site          | DEP "Sample Point ID" without depth designation |    |  
sample_date   | Date of sample collection    | yyyy-mm-dd format     |
month     | Month, derived from date     | Three letter codes    |
year      | Year, derived from date      |                  |    |
time      | time of sample               | 24 hour clock, hh:mm format |
hour      | hour, derived from time      |                       |
depth     | Sample Depth	               | Meters                |
irr_air   | Irradiance (air)              | µmol/m2/s            |
irr_water | Irradiance (surface water)    | µmol/m2/s            |
irr_pct_  | Irradiance (% of air in surface water) | %           |

# Review of Irradiance Data
## Scatterplot Matrix (Pairs Plot)
```{r scatterplot_matrix, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5 }
tmp <- irr_data %>%
  select(irr_air:irr_pct)
ggpairs(log(tmp), progress = FALSE)
```
Note skewed data distributions, even for the percentage values.

## Sites by Depths
```{r xtab_by_depth}
tmp <- irr_data %>%
  mutate(dpth_clss = if_else(depth < 2, round(depth, 1), round(depth,0)))
xtabs(~ dpth_clss + site, data = tmp)
rm(tmp)
```

It appears there are several different sampling conventions combined here:
*  Sampling with downcast at uneven shallow depths
*  Sampling at shallow half meter intervals to two meters and at
   one meter intervals beyond that point.

## How often was each site sampled?
We make an assumption here that sampling on one day is all related.
```{r sampling_frequency}
tmp <- irr_data %>%
  group_by(site, sample_date) %>%
  summarize(was_sampled = sum(! is.na(depth)) > 1,
            .groups = 'drop')
xt <- xtabs(~ sample_date + site, data = tmp)
tot <- colSums(xt)
tot
```

We identify the sites with the richest data history, and focus on them.
```{r high_freq_sites}
(preferred_sites <- names(tot[tot > 20]))
rm(tmp, xt)
```

We see clearly that certain sites had data collected much more frequently.
These are the same sites for which we have more abundant sonde data.  we 
will need to correlate these data in some intelligent way.

```{r plot_date_by_depth_2018}
irr_data %>%
  filter(year == 2018) %>%
  filter(site %in% preferred_sites) %>%
ggplot(aes(sample_date, depth, color = irr_water)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 3) +
   scale_colour_gradient(name = "Light (µmol/m2/s)",
                         low = scales::muted("lightblue", l = 10),
                         high = scales::muted("lightblue", l = 80)) +
   scale_y_reverse() +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom',
        legend.title = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.text =  element_text(size = 10),
        axis.ticks.length.x = unit(0, 'in')) +
  guides(color = guide_colourbar(title.position="top", barheight = .5))
  
```

```{r plot_light_by_depth, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
irr_data %>%
  filter(year == 2018) %>%
  filter(site %in% preferred_sites) %>%
ggplot(aes(depth, irr_pct, color = factor(sample_date))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = 'lm', formula = y ~ x) +
  scale_color_discrete(name = 'Date') +
  xlab('Irradiance') +
  ylab('Depth') +
  scale_y_reverse() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  theme(#legend.position = 'bottom',
        legend.title = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.text =  element_text(size = 10),
        axis.ticks.length.x = unit(0, 'in')) +
  #guides(color = guide_colorbar(title.position="top", barheight = .5)) +
  facet_wrap("site")
```

# Calculation of Light Extinction Coefficients
We develop an estimates of K  for each unique depth profile, using linear
regression. This is an ideal context for use of nested tibbles, as we eventually 
can drop the raw data and focus only on the derived quantities.

```{r calculate_k}
k_data <- irr_data %>%
  group_by(site, sample_date) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(the_lm = map(data, 
                      function(dat) lm(log(irr_pct) ~ depth, data = dat))) %>%
  mutate(k_est = map(the_lm, 
                     function(mod) -summary(mod)$coef[2, 1]), # extracts slope
         k_se = map(the_lm, 
                     function(mod) summary(mod)$coef[2, 2]), # extracts SE
         k_n =  map(data, 
                     function(dat) sum(! is.na(dat$irr_pct)))
         ) %>%
  mutate(site_name = map(data, function(dat) first(dat$site_name)[[1]]),
         month = map(data, function(dat) first(dat$month)[[1]]),
         year = map(data, function(dat) first(dat$year)[[1]]),
         start_hour = map(data, function(dat) min(dat$hour)[[1]]),
         doy = map(data, 
                   function(dat) as.numeric(format(min(sample_date), 
                                                   format = '%j')))) %>%

  select (-data, -the_lm) %>%
  unnest(everything()) %>%
  relocate(site_name, site, sample_date,  
           year, month, doy, start_hour) %>%
  filter(k_n >4) %>%         # Removes sample with only two light values 
  arrange(site, sample_date)
```

PRV70	on 2020-09-24 had only two samples, making the estimates of k unstable and
physically impossible.  As a result, that site strongly influences models
looking at k by location and date. We chose to delete any record (location by date) with fewer than five light values on which to base an estimate of k.

##Reorder `site` Factor
For some reason, we were having trouble reordering the levels in `site` 
according to light attenuation estimates within the usual dplyr workflows.

We resort to handling this manually (although this factor ordering will be lost
when importing from `*.csv` files, it's convenient to retain the code here for
reference.)

```{r reorder_site}
(my_lvls <- levels(fct_reorder(k_data$site, k_data$k_est, mean,  na.rm = TRUE)))

k_data <- k_data %>%
  mutate(site = factor(site, levels = my_lvls))
```

# Output Light Extinction Coefficient Data
```{r save_data}
write_csv(k_data, 'light_extinction_data.csv')
```
